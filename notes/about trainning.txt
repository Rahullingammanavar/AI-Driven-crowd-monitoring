🥇 Roboflow

Best for: Easy pipeline + YOLO integration + flexibility.

🔹 Why it’s great for person detection:

It already has pre-trained YOLOv8 models for “person” detection.

You can also fine-tune it on your own dataset — e.g., images from your CCTV, parking lot, etc.

One-click “Train YOLOv8” option.

You can deploy it easily on web, mobile, or edge devices (like Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi).

🔹 How to use:

Go to https://roboflow.com

Create a project → select “Object Detection (Bounding Boxes)”.

Upload your dataset (or even a few images).

Annotate only “person” boxes.

Click Train Model → Choose YOLOv8.

It will train automatically in the cloud.

You’ll get a hosted model + API + download options.

🔹 Exports available:

YOLOv8 / YOLOv5

TensorFlow

ONNX, CoreML (for mobile)

Deployment-ready (via their hosted API)
